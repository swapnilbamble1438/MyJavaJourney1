ArrayList:
1) ArrayList is an implemented class of List
   interface which is present in 
   java.util.package
  
   Syntax:   
          package java.util;
          class ArrayList implements List
          {
          		//constructors
          		//methods 
          		 
          }
2) ArrayList is created on the basis of 
   growable or resizeable array
            _ _ _ _
   array-> |_|_|_|_| its size once declare
   	    0 1 2 3  and array all elements are
   		     filled than we cannot add 
   		     extra element out of size of
   		     array. and we cannot decrease
   		     or increase the size of array
   		     once it is declare. It is not
   		     growable or resizeable. 
   	        _ _ _ _
   arraylist-> |_|_|_|_| we can add extra element
   		0 1 2 3  whenever we want.
   		         And its size can be 
   	                 decrease or increase.
   		         It is growable and
   		         resizeable.
   					     
3) Properties of ArrayList:
   i) ArrayList are index based DataStructure
   ii) ArrayList can store different data types
       or Hetrogenous data-types.
   iii) ArrayList can store duplicate values.
   iv) ArrayList can store multiple number of 
       null values.
   v) ArrayList follows the insertion order
      FIFO(First In First Out)  
      Means the sequence of display of elements
      will be same as the sequence of insertion
      of elements
   vi) ArrayList does not follow the sorting order.
   vii) ArrayList are non-synchronized
