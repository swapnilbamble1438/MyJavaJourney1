// JDK 1.0
   In this version java provides classes &
   interfaces in which we can store the data
   or objects 
   for e.g. Vector,Stack,Hashtable,Properties,
            Dictionary
            these are the legacy classes
            which are reintroduced in Collection
            Framework with modified version
            so these classes are called
            legacy class
            
            
   NOTE: All legacy classes are synchronized         
            
// JDK 1.2
   In this version Collection Framework was
   introduced            


=========================================================================

Vector:
1) Vector is a legacy class which was introduced in
   JDK 1.0 version.
2) Vector is an implemented class of List interface
   which is present in java.util package
   ->Syntax:
     package java.util
     class Vector implements List(Vector also implements Cloneable,Serializable,RandomAccess interface)
     {
      	//constructors
      	//methods
     }
3) The underline DataStructure of Vector is
   "growable array" or "resizeable array"
   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Properties of Vector:
1) Vector is an index based DataStructure
2) Vector can store heterogeneous elements
   or different data-types
3) We can store duplicate elements elements 
4) We can store multiple null values
5) Vector follows the insertion order
6) Vector does not follows the sorting order
7) Vector are synchronized collection      
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Methods of Vector class:
1) It contains List and Collection interface methods
2) addElement(Ojbect obj)
3) firstElement()
4) lastElement()
5) removeElement(Object obj)
6) removeElementAt(int index)
7) removeAllElements()
8) capacity(): this show the capacity of vector
