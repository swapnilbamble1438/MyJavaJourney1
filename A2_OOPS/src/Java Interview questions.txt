Q) what is java?
java is a multipurpose language that are use across the application use
uber,spotify,linkedin etc.

Q) features of java:
1) multithreading in java
2) almost Ojbect oriented language
	because they use primitive data type thus making it not a purely 
	objected oriented language
3) It is portable, secured, dynamic, concurrent, multithread
4) It is platform independent

Q)Platform:
The Hardware and software environment on which a program or application
runs is refered as a platform.

Q) Platform independent:
The ability of a programming language to run on different operation systems
without having significant adjustments is referred as platform independence.
Platform independent is achieved when code created in a certain language
may be executed on numerous operating systems after being copied
and ran without errors.
For example, if you develope code on Windows and it can be executed on
another operation system, such as linux , without problems, it is deemed
platform-independent. This code is also compatible with other operating
systems such as macOS, Unix and Solaris.

Q) why java is platform independent language?
java is compiled in two steps:
1) firt of all you compile java
	it converts into the .class file
	than .class file goes inside the jvm
	after which it compiles and run the code
	thus making it platform independent
	because jvm it is built by the customer specification
	for windows it would be different jvm for apple it 
	would be different jvm thus making it a platform
	independent language



Q) Why is Java a platform independent language?
Java language was developed in such a way that it does not depend 
on any hardware or software due to the fact that the compiler compiles 
the code and then converts it to platform-independent byte code 
which can be run on multiple systems.

The only condition to run that byte code is for the machine 
to have a runtime environment (JRE) installed in it

Q) How does program execute in java
* When we write a program we save the program with .java extension
*Basically, javac is the compiler that compiles the java code.
 javac compiler compiles the java code into Bytecode. which is also a .class file
* Now JVM which is an interpreter that executes the byte code into
  machine code
* and thus the user gets desired output

Q) JVM:
Java Virtual Machine.
Jvm executes the java programs.
It converts Java bytecode into machines language.
JVM operation: Loads code, verifies code, Executes code,
               Provide runtime environment

Q) How Java provides platform independenc?
Java platform independence comes from its virtual machine.
Java code is compiled into bytecodes.
JVM compiles the bytecodes into machine code for the operating system.

Q) what is jdk
1) java development kit
2) To run a java program, we must need a JDK
3) To create any kind of powerful java application, 
   JDK is just sufficient and enough powerful kit
   contains all the required software.
  * JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
  * Javac compiler
  * JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
  * Document generator
  * Other necessary library and tools


Q) what is JRE?
 contains all the extra classes or inbuilt classes
	it also checks or validate your bytecode.
mean if you want some extra code or want to use any inbuilt 
	class or function so that need will be fulfilled by JRE
	

Q) what is jvm?
1) Your code will run on JVM
2)jvm is a java virtual machine
	there are many things inside jvm
	like there is classloader inside
	jvm which loads the class based on the requirement of
	the program
	there is a bytecode checker and stuff like that aswell inside of jvm

Q) Stack and Heap Memory:

3. Difference between Heap and Stack Memory in java. And how java utilizes this.
Stack memory is the portion of memory that was assigned to every individual program.
 And it was fixed. On the other hand, Heap memory is the portion that was not 
allocated to the java program but it will be available for use by the java 
program when it is required, mostly during the runtime of the program.

Java Utilizes this memory as - 

When we write a java program then all the variables, methods, etc are stored 
in the stack memory.
And when we create any object in the java program then that object was 
created in the heap memory. And it was referenced from the stack memory.


Example- Consider the below java program:

class Main {
   public void printArray(int[] array){
       for(int i : array)
           System.out.println(i);
   }
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       int[] array = new int[10];
       printArray(array);
   }
}

For this java program. The stack and heap memory occupied by java is -


Main and PrintArray is the method that will be available in the stack area 
and as well as the variables declared that will also be in the stack area. 

And the Object (Integer Array of size 10) we have created, 
will be available in the Heap area because that space will
 be allocated to the program during runtime. 




Q) Can java be said to be the complete object-oriented programming language?
Yes  Because everything in java is under the classes.
And we can access that by creating the objects

But also if we say that java is not a completely object-oriented programming language 
because it has the support of primitive data types like int, 
float, char, boolean, double, etc.




Q) what do you understand by an instance variable and a local variable?
Instance variables are those variables that are accessible by all the methods in the class. They are declared outside the methods and inside the class. 
These variables describe the properties of an object and remain 
bound to it at any cost.

All the objects of the class will have their copy of the variables 
for utilization. If any modification is done on these variables, 
then only that instance will be impacted by it, and all other 
class instances continue to remain unaffected.

Example:

class Athlete {
public String athleteName;
public double athleteSpeed;
public int athleteAge;
}
Local variables are those variables present within a block, 
function, or constructor and can be accessed only inside them. 
The utilization of the variable is restricted to the block scope. 
Whenever a local variable is declared inside a method, the 
other class methods donâ€™t have any knowledge about the local variable.

Example:

public void athlete() {
String athleteName;
double athleteSpeed;
int athleteAge;
}


Example of Instance and Local Variables:

class Athlete
{                                      _
	public String athleteName;      |
	public double athleteSpeed;     |-----> Instance Variables
	public int athleteAge;         _|
	
	public Athlete(String name,double speed,int age)---> Local Variables
	{
		this.athleteName = name;
		this.athleteSpeed = speed;
		this.athlelteAge = age;
	}
	
	public void athleteRun()
	{
		int speed = 100;-------------> Local Variables
		System.out.println("Athlete runs at " + speed + "Km/hr");
	}
}


Q)What are the default values assigned to variables and instances in java?
There are no default values assigned to the variables in java. We need to 
initialize the value before using it. Otherwise, it will throw a compilation
 error of (Variable might not be initialized). 
But for instance, if we create the object, then the default value will be 
initialized by the default constructor depending on the data type. 
If it is a reference, then it will be assigned to null. 
If it is numeric, then it will assign to 0.
If it is a boolean, then it will be assigned to false. Etc.

Q) JIT compiler.
JIT stands for Just-In-Time and it is used for improving the performance during run time.

==============================================================================

Q) Main method:
it is an entry point of program
so each and every program that you compile should have a main method.
through which the prgram knows that the execution should be start from specific point

Q) syntax for main method:
access specifier - public static
return type - void
Name of function- main
and in curly bracket there is String[] array and arguments

Q) why is the main method static in java?
because we can reference it using the class like when we run the java
we say java and the name of class using that name of class you can
directly execute without anykind of object

Q) if we dont use static in main method than will our program run or not?
It will compile successfully but you will get error in runtime
like the error will say that the given function or main method is not present

Q) Exceptions:
there can be two kind of exceptions
i) there can be compile time exception:
	while writing the code you have to check some of the things
	and the error you face while compile the program that error would be
	compile time exception
	e.g: a) while connecting jdbc session while compiling the jdbc
		  you may get the sql exception like some insert or update query 
			is wrong or like class.for name is not written
	
ii) aswell as runtime exception:
	while executing a code you get exception that would be a runtime exception
	e.g: a)if I iterating a loop
			and dividing each elem by certain number
			and by mistake elem is divided by zero
			you may get arithmetic exception

Q) Exception handling:
 you can do Exception handling in two ways
 like try catch block and using throw keyword
 try catch block: it conist of three basic things
			from which one is optional
			and there is try and catch
			and in catch block you need to
			give the exception that can be occur
			there is a finally block that executes
			regardless the flow goes inside of the
			catch block or not
throws keyword very similar to try catch block
but there is syntax differce in them


Q) try with multiple catch is valid or not
	yes it is valid you can have multiple catch block
	inside of a try
	you can have nexted try block inside of try block
	you can have multple tryblock
	when I say try it means try and catch block both
	like you are checking for sql exception or 
	exception itself

Q) Difference between throw and throws keyword:
	first of all there is syntactical diferent in class
	one is written after the class and second one is written
	while you are checking some kind of error
	e.g basically throws keyword is used go to the
	exception block essentially
	e.g in program you are checking if the age is greater
	than 18 or not you have made a custom exception block for the same
	and incase the age is less than 18 you are writing a throw keyword
	so in that way you can use throw keyword	
	e.g: throws keyword usually followed by the name exception like sql or
	arithmetic or io exception

Q) finally block and final keyword:
 finally are used in exeption handling 
while final is used in variable,method or a class

Q) what will be the default value for variable and instance?
 for int i; it will be 0
     float i; 0.0
	double i; 0.0d
	String i;  null

Q) Collection Framework
 Collection Framworks helps to store your data in certain way.
Each and Every collection is different in its own way.
one of the interface is list interface from which you can make
list,array,Stack,queues,linkedlist,hashmap,arraylist,hashset aswell

Q) Difference between Array and Arraylist
so arrays are basically a predefined set of values.
like if when I sayy Array of length 5 it will be just the array of 
length 5.
But When I say Arraylist I can dynamically grow the
length size.

Arrays are  more memory efficient if I say array of length five
I know that this much memory space will occupied not more than that
and if I had to add one more element to it than I have to make 
new array and copy the elements of old array and adding new elements.
But in Arraylist there is a function called add by which
you can add new Elems and increase the size as well

Q) In case of array how can you add the element
If I want to assign the element I will do it by using indexing.
I will write array name followed by square bracket and inside bracket
than =  and assign some value

Q) Package in java
packages are basically logically grouping or logical folders of java.
which are seen inside of a project will be the folder kind of things.
like com.demo.entities so there wiil be a com folder inwhich there
will be a demo folder inwhich there will be an entities folder
inwhich I will keep all my entities class

Q) Why package are used
if you have packages it will help you
while developing any thing, packages helps to manage the classes
and we know exactly where do we need to find the classes. like if I want to find the entity classes I will search the entity package
be able to find the class. And I dont need to search the entire project
inorder to find the certain class

Q) so have you used any inbuilt package
 Yes I used scanner package

Q) what are the main pillars in OOPS concepts
Main pillars of OOPs concept would be Abstraction, Polymorphism,
Encapsulation, Inheritance

Q) Data Abstraction
so basically in program you dont really want to know what exactly a function is doing you can do the same with the help of abstraction
while you give the user just a function that they need to execute itself
and they dont need to worry about how it is implemented
or which are the different classes are used inside specific function
with the help of this you can achieve abstraction
thus making it much more easier to understand the project and
making the consistency itself

Q) Encapsulation is used for data hiding. 
 it is used using access modifiers like
 Public, protected, private , default  are access specifier.
Using this we can define the scope of the variable or the functions.
like if it it public it can be used all through 
and if it is protected than only subclasses can be used it 
and if private than only the current class can use it.

Q) storage classes
