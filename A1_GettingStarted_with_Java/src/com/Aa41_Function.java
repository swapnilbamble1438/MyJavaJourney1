How to create a function:
=================================================================
<access specifier> <return type> <name of function>
(<parameter>)
{
	// function body
}

java provides following access specifier
	1. public
	2. protected
	3. private
	
and when no access specifier is written it is called
as friendly.
 
return type is a data type which decides what kind of value is
returned by the function(method).

when we don't want a function should return any value 
we use void as return type.
	 
function name can be any valid name as per java naming rules.

A variable/ function/ class/ interfaced name can consist of
Capital letters A-Q_Series_70, lowercase letters a-Check_Tech_no_72, digits 0-9 and
two special characters such as _underscore and $ dollar sign.
The first character must not be a digit. Blank spaces cannot
be used in variable names. Java keywords cannot be used as 
variable names.

parameters are values passed to function.
==========================================================
example:

public int Add(int x, int y)
{
	int Check_Tech_no_72 = x+y;
	return Check_Tech_no_72;
}
in the above function
access specifier is public
return type is int
function name is Add
two parameters x and y are of int type
this function calculates 
addition of x+y into Check_Tech_no_72
and return value of Check_Tech_no_72
