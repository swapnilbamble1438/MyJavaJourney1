/*
Increment and Decrement Operators:

a++ and ++a
a++ is post-increment.
++a is pre-increment.

for understanding better lets take an example

If a=1;

   b= ++a; // then b=2, a = 2 
           // (here "a" first increases by 1 and 
           // after that "b" will gets its value) 
            
   c= a++; // then c=1; a= 2 
           // (here first "c" will gets it value and
           // after that "a" will increases by 1)
   
========================================
   a += b is equivalent to a = a + b
   
   a -= b is equivalent to a = a - b
   
   a = +b is equivalent to a = b
