How to understand & approach the problem in Recursion

1) Identify if you can break your problem
   into smaller problems
2) Write the recurrence relation if needed
3) Draw the recursive tree
4) About the tree:
   i) see the flow of function,
      how they are getting in stack
   ii) Identify the flow of left tree
       calls and right tree calls
   iii) Draw the tree and position again
        and again using pen & paper
   iv) Use a debugger to see the flow
   v) See how the values are returned
      at each steps
   vi) see where the function call will come
       out
   vii) And in the end you will come out of
        the main function
